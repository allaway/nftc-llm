Both cell lines share the TP53 mutations c.925C>T (p.P309S) and c.818G>A (p.R273H). SW620 exhibits high levels of potentially bisected complex or hybrid N-glycan structures compared to non-metastatic cell lines, which may be related to its metastatic origin.","['Cell line origin', 'Genomics', 'Glycomics']",,,,https://www.doi.org/10.1074/mcp.M115.051235
