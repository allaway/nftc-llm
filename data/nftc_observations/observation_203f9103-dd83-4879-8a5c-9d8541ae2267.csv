203f9103-dd83-4879-8a5c-9d8541ae2267,STSA-1,['Cell Line'],The STSA-1 cell line is derived from a soft tissue sarcoma tumor in a 7-year-old male golden retriever dog. The cells are spindle-shaped with long extensions and do not form closed monolayers in culture.,"['Cell morphology', 'Cell line origin']",,,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0037239
203f9103-dd83-4879-8a5c-9d8541ae2267,STSA-1,['Cell Line'],"The STSA-1 cell line is highly tumorigenic when injected into immunodeficient mice, forming tumors that mimic the malignant features of the original soft tissue sarcoma, including mitotic figures, anisokaryosis, anisocytosis, binucleation and multinucleation.","['Tumor formation', 'Histology']",,,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0037239
203f9103-dd83-4879-8a5c-9d8541ae2267,STSA-1,['Cell Line'],"The vaccinia virus strains LIVP1.1.1 and GLV-1h68 efficiently infected and killed STSA-1 cells in culture at multiplicities of infection of 1.0 and 0.1 respectively, demonstrating the oncolytic potential of these viruses against the STSA-1 canine sarcoma cell line.","['Viral infection', 'Cell viability']",,,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0037239
