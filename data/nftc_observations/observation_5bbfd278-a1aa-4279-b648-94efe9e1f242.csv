5bbfd278-a1aa-4279-b648-94efe9e1f242,AsPC-1,['Cell Line'],The AsPC-1 cell line was derived from the ascites of a 62-year-old woman with pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastatic to several abdominal organs. The cell line was noted to produce abundant mucin and carcinoembryonic antigen.,"['Cell line derivation', 'Biomarker expression']",,,,https://doi.org/10.1097/MPA.0b013e3181c15963
