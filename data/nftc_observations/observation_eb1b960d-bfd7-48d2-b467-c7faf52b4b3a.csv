eb1b960d-bfd7-48d2-b467-c7faf52b4b3a,SK-N-SH,['Cell Line'],"The SK-N-SH cell line has a single copy of the N-myc oncogene and undetectable expression of the N-myc transcript, possibly due to the relatively short exposure time used in the assay.","['Genomics', 'Gene expression']",,,,https://www.doi.org/10.1203/00006450-199001000-00001
eb1b960d-bfd7-48d2-b467-c7faf52b4b3a,SK-N-SH,['Cell Line'],The SK-N-SH cell line comprises two cell types: a large fraction of epithelial Schwann cells (S-type) and a small number of neuroblast cells (N-type). The S-type cells elongate and undergo cell death upon sequential treatment with retinoic acid and BDNF under serum-free conditions.,"['Cell morphology', 'Cell viability']",,,,https://www.doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-1-95
eb1b960d-bfd7-48d2-b467-c7faf52b4b3a,SK-N-SH,['Cell Line'],The SK-N-SH cell line was used for cell line authentication by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis prior to conducting experiments.,"['Cell line identity', 'Experimental methods']",,,,https://www.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172140
